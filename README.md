Welcome to Famtrees.pump this is a project I'm working where I try to make a model for data provided by Solana specfically watching Pump.fun transactions and logs. My hope is to make this into a prediction model with the hopes of using other models or layers to determine various flows with meme coins. I'd like the end game of this be a tool to analyze the markets and predict trends. For now I'm trying to predict transactions and logs, and we'll just keep going until I'm dead.
