# The Famtrees.pump Model

This is a project I'm working on where I try to make a model for data provided by the Solana network specfically watching Pump.fun transactions and logs. 

Currently this is a simple prediction model with the hopes of using other models or layers to determine various flows with respect to meme coins. I'd like the end game of this be a tool to analyze the markets and predict trends potentially give advice on how to best handle trades at that exact moment. However for now I'm trying to predict a sequence of transactions and logs on concatenated data using tokens, and we'll just keep building on it until I'm dead.
